# all-plugin-versions

A WordPress plugin for viewing versions of all currently installed plugins.

This plugin creates a sub-menu under the settings menu on the dashboard. It will display all the currently installed plugins along with the current version.

The plugin is useful for keeping track of the version while updating so we know which version to rollback to.
